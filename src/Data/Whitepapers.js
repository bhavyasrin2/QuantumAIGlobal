The current best algorithm for 3SAT is one such example. Generic constraint satisfaction problems also see quadratic speedups with Grover. These algorithms do not require that the input be given in the form of an oracle, since Grover's algorithm is being applied with an explicit function, e.g. the function checking that a set of bits satisfies a 3SAT instance. Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup.",
//             "Shor’s Algorithm": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of superpolynomial speedup compared to best known classical (that is, non-quantum) algorithms. Shor proposed multiple similar algorithms solving the factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period finding problem. Shor's algorithm usually refers to his algorithm solving factoring, but may also refer to each of the three. The discrete logarithm algorithm and the factoring algorithm are instances of the period finding algorithm, and all three are instances of the hidden subgroup problem..RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally intractable. As far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring integers is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers, and for the study of new quantum-computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called Post-Quantum Cryptography.",

Cryptosystems based on lattice problems have received renewed interest.New applications (such as fully homomorphic encryption, code obfuscation, and attribute-based encryption) have been made possible using lattice-based cryptography.Most lattice-based key establishment algorithms are relatively simple, efficient, and highly parallelizable. Also, the security of some lattice-based systems are provably secure under a worst-case hardness assumption, rather than on the average case.This approach includes cryptographic systems such as learning with errors, ring learning with errors (ring-LWE), the ringlearning with errors key exchange and the ring learning with errors signature, the older NTRU (n-th degree Truncated polynomial Ring Unit) or GGH encryption schemes, and the newer NTRU signature and BLISS signatures. Crystals Kyber uses the complex mathematics of MLWE (Modular Learning with Error) principle to generate its public and private keys which are resistant to any of currently present quantum algorithms. So, they are being standardized by NIST for its commercial usage as well keeping the prospects of Post Quantum Era threats.',

            "The Post QuantumCryptography Product": "QSleeve is developed keeping in mind about the future of secured communication. With the advent of quantum algorithms and the threats emerging with them in the paradigm of communication and data security, a product which will secure the data of Fan organization in such times became a necessity. QSleeve is filling that void and providing a solution to it. It provides an extra layer of encryption methodology over the prevailing security system that is being used by the organization’s internal network security.",
            "The Idea of its DevelopmentThe Idea of its Development": "As the world moves towards the Quantum revolution, construction of a large-scale quantum computer would render many of the prevailing public key cryptosystems insecure. In particular, this includes those based on the difficulty of integer factorization, such as RSA, as well as ones based on the hardness of the discrete log problem. Quantum processor not only speed up the processing of data but also its capability of parallelizing the algorithms for deriving solutions to a specific problem is an advantage in digital sphere.",
            "Grover’s Search Algorithm": "Grover's algorithm, along with variants like amplitude amplification, can be used to speed up a broad range of algorithms.In particular, algorithms for NP-complete problems generally contain exhaustive search as a subroutine, which can be sped up by Grover's algorithm. The current best algorithm for 3SAT is one such example. Generic constraint satisfaction problems also see quadratic speedups with Grover. These algorithms do not require that the input be given in the form of an oracle, since Grover's algorithm is being applied with an explicit function, e.g. the function checking that a set of bits satisfies a 3SAT instance. Unlike other quantum algorithms, which may provide exponential speedup over their classical counterparts, Grover's algorithm provides only a quadratic speedup.",
            "Shor’s Algorithm": "Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by the American mathematician. It is one of the few known quantum algorithms with compelling potential applications and strong evidence of superpolynomial speedup compared to best known classical (that is, non-quantum) algorithms. Shor proposed multiple similar algorithms solving the factoring problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the period finding problem. Shor's algorithm usually refers to his algorithm solving factoring, but may also refer to each of the three. The discrete logarithm algorithm and the factoring algorithm are instances of the period finding algorithm, and all three are instances of the hidden subgroup problem..RSA is based on the assumption that factoring large integers is computationally intractable. As far as is known, this assumption is valid for classical (non-quantum) computers; no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, Shor's algorithm shows that factoring integers is efficient on an ideal quantum computer, so it may be feasible to defeat RSA by constructing a large quantum computer. It was also a powerful motivator for the design and construction of quantum computers, and for the study of new quantum-computer algorithms. It has also facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called Post-Quantum Cryptography.",
            "Why Crystals Kyber": 'Crystals Kyber is a lattice-based cryptography. Lattice a mathematical structure defined by the product of integer and vector points over a graph. Cryptosystems based on lattice problems have received renewed interest.New applications (such as fully homomorphic encryption, code obfuscation, and attribute-based encryption) have been made possible using lattice-based cryptography.Most lattice-based key establishment algorithms are relatively simple, efficient, and highly parallelizable. Also, the security of some lattice-based systems are provably secure under a worst-case hardness assumption, rather than on the average case.This approach includes cryptographic systems such as learning with errors, ring learning with errors (ring-LWE), the ringlearning with errors key exchange and the ring learning with errors signature, the older NTRU (n-th degree Truncated polynomial Ring Unit) or GGH encryption schemes, and the newer NTRU signature and BLISS signatures. Crystals Kyber uses the complex mathematics of MLWE (Modular Learning with Error) principle to generate its public and private keys which are resistant to any of currently present quantum algorithms. So, they are being standardized by NIST for its commercial usage as well keeping the prospects of Post Quantum Era threats.',
            "Future of QSleeve": "Currently QSleeve is designed to generate and provide a mechanism to exchange the quantum resistant encryption keys to an organization for its internal network usage. It is designed in such a way that its scalability to become a full-fledged encryption mechanism and software which will be able to be used even in future communication infrastructure where the system is readied to incorporate the post quantum cryptography algorithms as a replacement to currently prevalent RSA and Diffie Hellman methods for key exchange."
