The term Y2Q, more conveniently called Years to Quantum or the Q-DAY is not a distant future to us. This patent drives the development of our product Q-Sleeve which is based on the Post Quantum Cryptography algorithms which are considered to be quantum resistant. This will work above the current internet system within the organization and keep the data encrypted facilitating the security for Post Quantum Era (PQE) as well. By enabling this mechanism on an end user communication system will ensure that the data will still remain encrypted even if the public cryptosystem gets broken.",
